# sql-challenge
All code written by me, Christopher Benson. No additional resources to cite. Notes from class were the only assistance needed for this challenge. Script for table schemata can be found at in the "EmployeeSQL" directory as "EmployeeSQL_tables.sql". Script for queries can be found at in the "EmployeeSQL" directory as "EmployeeSQL_queries.sql". Entity Relationship Diagrams can be found in the "EmployeeSQL" directory as "Database Diagram-EmployeesSQL.pdf" and "Database Diagram-EmployeesSQL.png". The png is a visual representation of the relationships, while the pdf offers a more detailed listing of the entities, their attributes, and relationships.
